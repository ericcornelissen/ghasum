# Release Guidelines

To release a new version of the `ghasum` project follow these steps (using
v1.2.3 as an example):

1. Make sure that your local copy of the repository is up-to-date, sync:

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

   Or clone:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ericcornelissen/ghasum.git
   ```

1. Update the version number following to the current year-month pair in the
  `cmd/ghasum/version.go` file:

   ```diff
   - const version = "1.2.2"
   + const version = "1.2.3"
   ```

1. Commit the changes to a new branch and push using:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b 'version-bump'
   git add 'cmd/ghasum/version.go'
   git commit --message 'version bump'
   git push origin 'version-bump'
   ```

1. Create a Pull Request to merge the new branch into `main`.

1. Merge the Pull Request if the changes look OK and all continuous integration
   checks are passing.

1. Immediately after the Pull Request is merged, sync the `main` branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

1. Create a [git tag] for the new version and push it:

   ```shell
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

   > **Note**: At this point, the continuous delivery automation may pick up and
   > complete the release process. If not, or only partially, continue following
   > the remaining steps.

1. Create pre-compiled binaries - with checksums - for various targets using:

   ```shell
   go run tasks.go build-all
   ```

1. Create a [GitHub Release] for the [git tag] of the new release. The release
   title should be "Release {_version_}" (e.g. "Release v1.2.3"). The release
   text should be "{_version_}" (e.g. "v1.2.3"). The release artifact should be
   the pre-compiled binaries, including checksums, from the previous step.
